# A Recommendation System Based on Graph Theory

This project is part of "A Network Tour of Data Science" course.

The goal of this project is to analyze the content created by an open community. Through the light of networks, it is possible to examine how music tracks relate to each other. Does genre structure the music? Do we observe groups of similar artists? Can we build a playlist that links two tracks through a smooth transition? To answer those questions, we will build a similarity graph between music tracks.
For this project we will use the Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset (provided by TAs of the course) to explore these hypothesis and try to build a recommendation system based on a graph networks.

# Dataset
The <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/">Free Music Archive (FMA)</a> is a free and open library directed by <a href="https://wfmu.org/">WFMU</a>, the longest-running freeform radio station in the United States. Inspired by <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> and the open-source software movement, the FMA provides a platform for curators, artists, and listeners to harness the potential of music sharing. The website provides a large catalog of artists and tracks, hand-picked by established audio curators. Each track is legally free to download as artists decided to release their works under permissive licenses.

# Milestones:
1- Network properties:
  The object of this milestone is to start getting acquainted to the network that we will use for this project. In the first part of the milestone, we will load the features into Pandas dataframes and will create the adjacency matrix using Numpy. In the second part we will compute some basic properties of our network.
2- Network models:
  The purpose of this milestone is to explore various random network models, analyse their properties and compare them to your network. In the first part of the milestone you will implement two random graph models and try to fit them to your network.
3- <<a href="#">Spectral graph theory</a>:
  The goal of this milestone is to use the graph Laplacian and its spectral decomposition for extracting information about the graph.
4- <a href="#">Graph signal processing</a>:
  The goal of this milestone is to do some Graph Signal Processing (GSP) on the data of your project to extract insights about the structure of our network.
5 - Final Milestone: (Ongoing...)
