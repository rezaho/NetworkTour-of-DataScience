# Playlist Generation Based on Graph Theory

This project is part of "A Network Tour of Data Science" course.

The objective of this project is to generate a playlist that can bring the listener from his actual mood (e.g. angry or sad) to a mood he would like to be in (e.g. relaxed or happy). Through the light of networks, it is possible to examine how music tracks relate to each other. Can we build a playlist that links two very different tracks through a smooth transition? To answer this question, we will build a similarity graph between music tracks and choose a smooth path taking into account user's preference.

# Dataset
In total, the project used four datasets, namely:

1. Userâ€™s History (Million Songs Dataset): [Million Songs Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/tasteprofile) (download link)
2. Audio Features (from Spotify API): run code in [Collecting and Preproccessing Data](https://github.com/rezaho/NetworkTour-of-DataScience/blob/master/Collecting_and_Preproccessing_Data.ipynb)
3. MetaData (from Spotify API): run code in [Collecting Meta Data](https://github.com/rezaho/NetworkTour-of-DataScience/blob/master/Collecting_Meta_Data.ipynb)
4. Librosa Features (Computed with Librosa Library): run code in [Collecting and Preproccessing Data](https://github.com/rezaho/NetworkTour-of-DataScience/blob/master/Collecting_and_Preproccessing_Data.ipynb)

Once all datasets are installed, the graph is generated:

Finally, the following practical options are available in order to generate a playlist to change user's mood:
[Generating Playlist](https://github.com/rezaho/NetworkTour-of-DataScience/blob/master/Generating_Playlists.ipynb)

1. Seed/end song selection.

If the user wants the algorithm to define the seed(start) song or end song according to his/her mood selections,   he/she should assign to the variables end_song/seed_song the value returned by the function song_selection(Danceability,Energy,Valence) where the parameters represent the each mood dimension and should be between 0 and 1. 
If the user has a particular seed/end song that he wants to use, he/she can assign to the variables seed_song/end_song the corresponding node number of the desired songs (index of the adjacency matrix). 

2. Cutoff (playlist lenght)
If the user wants the playlist generated to have a specific lenght, he/she should adjust the variable "cutoff" in the network X method all_simple_paths. The playlist generated will have a maximum lenght of cutoff+1. Be aware that for comptational time reasons, cutoff should not be too much bigger (+3 max) than the shortest path lenght (otherwise to many paths are generated). 

3. Lambda factor: This factor can be adjusted depending on how much the user wants the songs in the playlist to take into account his taste.
